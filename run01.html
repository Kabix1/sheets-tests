Your room is just the way you left it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: *sigh*<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br>Player chose: I've played this before<br><hr>Week 1<br><br>(Studied Trade in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 2<br><br>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br>Player chose: Arrest her<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are a traitor to the crown and I ought to have you executed.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: GUARDS! Arrest her!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Throw her into the castle dungeons and let her rot!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Well. I suppose she won't be a problem anymore.<br> A walk in the fresh air helps you forget the burdens on your shoulders.<br><hr>Week 3<br><br>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the morning.)<br>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the afternoon.)<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Me too.<br> You gather your skirts and prepare to sit down, when all of a sudden, a hissing noise alerts you to a hidden danger - a snake!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Charlotte, don't move!<br> You grab for a stick to push the snake away, but you lack the skills to do the job properly, and poking the snake only makes it angry. Too fast to see, it lunges forward and sinks its fangs into your leg!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: OW!<br> The snake slithers away, but it's too late now. A strange tingling sensation begins to spread through your flesh.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: That's a milk viper. They're poisonous!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't feel good.<br> Your leg is going numb. You stumble and fall to the ground.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hold on!<br> Your cousin kneels beside you and presses her hands over the bite mark. The area throbs painfully, then begins to feel warm.<br> After a minute, you're dizzy, but your leg isn't buzzing anymore, and even the wound has disappeared.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How did you do that?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I don't know how I do it. I just can.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I'm not supposed to tell anybody. People think it's freaky. You won't tell, will you?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Of course not. I'm just lucky you were here.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Girls? What's going on out here? I heard yelling.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Nothing!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We saw a snake, but it got away.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: A snake! That's it. Charlotte, pack your things. We're going back to Merva. It's not safe here.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Awww...<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 4<br><br>(Studied Herbs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Herbs in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br> You venture into the depths of the castle dungeons.<br> The Duchess of Ursul is there, in her cell, sitting perfectly straight on the bench against the wall and looking your direction as if she'd been expecting you.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Caution is wise for one in your position. Hasty judgments can lead to trouble.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Are you ready to listen now?<br>Menu: [Hear her out] [Taunt her] <br>Player chose: Hear her out<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you want to say?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It is the responsibility of the king or queen of Nova to handle magical energies to protect the domain.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is what a Lumen does - what your mother did, and what I do.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father said it was your fault she died!<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: What he said was that she died by magic. Being a Lumen is never <i>safe.</i> We pay a high price for our powers.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: But without a Lumen queen, this entire domain is at risk.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Release me, and I will teach you what you need to know to keep your responsibilities.<br>Menu: [Free her] [Refuse] <br>Player chose: Free her<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't have any choice, do I?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine. I'll have the guards release you.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Come to me in my rooms as soon as you can to begin your training.<br><hr>Week 5<br><br>(Studied Climbing in the morning.)<br>(Studied Climbing in the afternoon.)<br> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We have a Duke of Sedna?<br>Alice: ... No, my Lady. The duchy of Sedna is in Talasse.<br>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Something sparkly will make me feel better.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 6<br><br>(Studied Elegance in the morning.)<br>(Studied Elegance in the afternoon.)<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Your Royal Highness. I would speak with you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What is it?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: You have many questions, and the answers are within your grasp. You need only choose to seek them.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Speak to the Duchess of Ursul. She will guide you on your path.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What is it you wanted to teach me?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: First, I need to know if you have your mother's crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The source of power for any Lumen is a particular magical crystal. Once you've bonded with it, it becomes a part of you as long as you live.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The Royal Crystal has been passed down from ruler to ruler for generations. It belongs to you, now - except that the King may be keeping it from you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Do you have a crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Of course.<br> She holds out her hands. Light flickers above her bosom, and then, with a shower of sparkles, something takes shape.<br> You reach out to touch it, and it dissolves away into nothing.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It belongs to me. No one can take it from me until I die.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You need to find the crystal that belongs to you.<br><hr>Week 7<br><br>(Studied Trade in the morning.)<br>(Studied Production in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br> You gracefully step aside and let her pass.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How do I find my Lumen crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your father probably knows what happened to it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What if he destroyed it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: They can't be destroyed. He could throw it away, but then someone else might find it. No, he'll keep it safe.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But if it's mine, it wouldn't matter if someone else found it.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It's attuned to you, but you haven't bonded with it yet. If it found a compatible host, someone who was <i>like</i> you in some way, it could bond to them.<br><hr>Week 8<br><br>(Studied Production in the morning.)<br>(Studied Production in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hmm. If it really works, that could be a very important invention.)<br>Menu: [Invest] [Don't invest] <br>Player chose: Invest<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We would be happy to invest in your venture.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad, what happened to Mom's Lumen crystal?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It's in a safe place.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Can I have it?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But it's mine!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Meddling with magic killed your mother. I don't want that to happen to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Once you're crowned Queen, I can't stop you from doing anything you want, but for now you are still a child.<br><hr>Week 9<br><br>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I know there's been some problems with Ixion, but I don't know the details. I guess they're occupying southern Maree.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything about the military. I don't want to fight.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, if I may ask... That necklace you're wearing. Where did it come from?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It was a gift from the Duke of Sedna.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Then, you have made arrangements with him?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Um... What sort of arrangements?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, that is a courting gift. The man wishes to gain your hand in marriage.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh. I didn't realise.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father says I can't have the crystal until I'm Queen, so we'll just have to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: There may not be time to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: This world is filled with dangers, and you will need the powers of a Lumen to fight them. You can't begin training until you have bonded with your crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what else am I supposed to do about it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The crystal is probably held under guard in the Royal Treasury. You are the princess; you should be able to find a way inside.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Otherwise we might have to take drastic action.<br>Menu: [I'll wait until I'm older] [I'll try to find a way] [What drastic action?] <br>Player chose: I'll try to find a way<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: All right. I will try to get into the treasury.<br>(Put on the economics outfit.)<br><hr>Week 10<br><br>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Bluff / Intimidate<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are trespassing on our lands. You will withdraw your troops at once. Only then will we have peace.<br>Menu: [Threaten to attack] <br>Player chose: Threaten to attack<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: My soldiers are poised to destroy you. Withdraw now.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Then I'm very sorry we were not able to come to an agreement.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I guess now we have to fight.)<br> You overwhelm the guards with facts and figures, explaining that you need treasury access to adjust the royal budget, which may affect their pay packets as well as the taxes assessed on their friends and family. They stand aside.<br> The glitter is dazzling, but some sixth sense draws you towards one little locked box in particular. <b>This</b> is what you need. This is the crystal that will make you a Lumen.<br> You tuck the box into your pocket. You can show it to your mentor later and get instructions on what to do next.<br><hr>Week 11<br><br>(Studied Poison in the morning.)<br>(Studied Poison in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br> You receive a report on the outcome of the battle against the Ixionites.<br> You succeeded in driving them out of Maree, but it cost you almost a full battalion of soldiers and a great deal of materiel.<br> You lost 1032 soldiers.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The Duke of Maree will be happy, but we could have done better!<br> You also receive a letter informing you that Talarist, Duke of Sedna, will be arriving for an official visit next week.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad, if this trouble with Ixion started years ago, why didn't Mom fix it?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your mother told the Duke of Maree and the Duchess of Hellas that it was their problem and they should sort it out themselves.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Should I have done that?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The situation is different now. Everyone on all sides wishes to see what sort of Queen is coming to the throne.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Everyone is judging me.)<br>(Put on the medicine outfit.):  The game will now attempt to save the log and open it in a web browser.<br>Menu: [Continue] [Cancel] <br>Player chose: Continue<br> Log saved to /home/olle/.renpy/LongLiveTheQueen/log.html
Starting browser.<br><hr>Week 12<br><br>(Studied Logistics in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: Ah, Your Highness. What a pleasure it is to meet you in person at last. Your description did not do you justice.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: *giggle*<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know how to deal with handsome older men paying me compliments!)<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: I was so pleased to hear that you had accepted my humble offering. A jewel for a jewel - but you are the more precious.<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: I hope that this is only the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. A union between us would bring stability to both our peoples.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (He really does want to marry me!)<br>Menu: [Accept his offer] [Politely decline] <br>Player chose: Accept his offer<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I would be honored!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Elodie!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your Grace, are you not aware that my daughter has only fourteen summers?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's my decision.<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: A betrothal only, of course. There is no need for hurry. You have your coronation to plan for, after all.<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: If I might be of service in any way, please, send for me. I will be happy to offer my protection or advice.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: ...<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 13<br><br>(Studied Logistics in the morning.)<br> Your skill in Logistics is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Military skills are 25 or higher.<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br> Your skill in Logistics is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Military skills are 25 or higher.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A woman has been convicted of attempted murder and requests the mercy of the Crown.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Your Highness! This slattern dares to beg pardon, when she <b>admits</b> that she tried to poison my sister under her own roof!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Which sister?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Corisande, the Duchess of Mead.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is she all right?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: She is unharmed. We caught the culprit in the kitchens before anyone could eat her foul spew.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?<br>Condemned Woman: It's justice, it is! Them devils killed me brother, and broke me mam's heart.<br>Condemned Woman: Lied to her, they did, when she went to see why he'd not come back. Said he'd gone for a soldier, when he never would!<br>Condemned Woman: He weren't the only one neither. I waited ten years for my chance to get my own back. That's justice!<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: You see? She's completely unrepentant! Hang her and be done with it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know what this is all about. Either way, murder is a serious crime, but...)<br>Menu: [Put her to work] [Imprison her] [Execute her] <br>Player chose: Execute her<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: As she is clearly guilty, her life is forfeit. She will be hanged in public as a deterrent to other criminals.<br>Condemned Woman: Ye'll not have me!<br> All of a sudden, she breaks loose from her guards and rushes at you!<br> In your Court dress, you are unarmed - you grope for a weapon and find only a heavy golden ornament which you hurl in her direction.<br> Your missile flies wide of its mark.<br> Before you have a chance to do anything else, your personal guards step into action, cutting the woman down before she can endanger you. Her lifeless body lies bleeding on your carpet.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Get that out of here. Put it on display, so that everyone sees what happens to criminals.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I got it!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do I do now?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Pick up the crystal with your bare hands. Press it against your chest, over your heart, and say <i>"Illuminate!"</i><br>Menu: [Do it] [Don't do it] <br>Player chose: Do it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Okay... Here we go... 
 Illuminate!<br> You feel dizzy, and both larger and lighter than you were before. The crystal has disappeared from view, but <i>you</i> know where it is.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Wow.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The priestess here is a friend of mine. I will come to your lessons in the faith and train you to use your powers.<br><hr>Week 14<br><br>(Studied Public Speaking in the morning.)<br>(Studied Public Speaking in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking one day in the gardens, you hear a strange sound and look up to see an owl flying overhead. A single dry leaf flutters in its talons.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's funny, I thought owls were nocturnal. I guess I was wrong.)<br> When you return to the castle, your father is waiting for you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br> You pay your respects to your mother's tomb, and wonder if the same fate is waiting for you.<br><hr>Week 15<br><br>(Studied Sense Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Sense Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember that the Festival of the Good Lady is approaching.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There will be public celebrations for the commoners, followed by a grand gala for the nobility.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A grand ball... There will be dancing.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you would be expected to lead the procession and take part in the ceremonial planting, possibly give a speech.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: However, since you are not yet crowned, it is not required, and it may not be safe to expose you to the public.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, not safe?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Outside of the castle, you are less well protected. If anyone means you harm... Think on it now, decide later.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Will the Duke of Sedna attend the gala?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It is a traditional Novan event. Inviting your fiancé might be seen as a statement.<br>Menu: [Invite Talarist] [Don't] <br>Player chose: Don't<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe some other time.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Word has come from the factory for books that you funded. They have assembled enough equipment to begin printing test pamphlets.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As their royal sponsor, it is your right to decide the content of the first printing.<br>Menu: [Poems praising your mother] [Pro-Lumen propaganda] [Religious doctrine] <br>Player chose: Pro-Lumen propaganda<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I think the people of Nova don't have enough respect for magic-users. I want to print pamphlets about Lumens.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I want to show everyone how magic can do <i>good</i> things.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: ... As you wish.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a letter for you as well.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's from Briony! I went to school with her, but she's a couple years older than me. Her mother is the Duchess of Mead.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's complaining that her mother still won't let her come home for the holidays.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Apparently her uncle Kevan has been acting strangely lately and shouting at shadows.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's bored and looking for an adventure. Well, I don't have any to suggest to her!)<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 16<br><br>(Studied Resist Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Resist Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Today is the procession and planting for the Festival of the Good Lady. Will you be leading the parade?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If you have any concerns about your safety, please, stay here.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The people will recover from disappointment; if we lose you, there is no recovery.<br>Menu: [I will lead the parade] [I will parade and make a speech] [I would rather not go] <br>Player chose: I would rather not go<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No... I guess I'd rather stay here.<br> You watch the procession from your tower window, feeling safe but lonely.<br> Suddenly, you hear someone moving around inside your room. You turn in surprise, but it's only a maid.<br>Alice: My lady? What are you - Should you not be in the procession?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's a major festival, but there are other ways to celebrate.)<br>Menu: [Confess your fears] [Yell at her] [Make religious excuse] <br>Player chose: Confess your fears<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I can't go outside... there might be assassins.<br>Alice: Oh.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 17<br><br>(Studied Wield Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Wield Magic in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Are you ready for the grand ball?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All the nobles in the domain are here to see you - to see their queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (gulp!)<br> You finish dressing and descend the stairs to make a grand entrance.<br> All around, the rich and powerful pause in their activities to gaze upon you, the ruler of them all.<br> Seeing yourself reflected in so many eyes makes you want to run away and hide.<br> After a moment, you force yourself to carry on, but you're sure they've all seen you hesitate.<br> Your father waits for you at the bottom of the stairs and offers you his arm.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The first dance is for us.<br> He guides you gently around the dance floor, never rushing you. It's fun to dance with your father, but the look in his eyes is so sad.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: After this, you must choose your own partner. There are a number of men who hope to catch your eye.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke of Kigal alone has brought three eligible sons, all near your age.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But I'm already betrothed to the Duke of Sedna!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: That does not bar you from dancing.<br>Menu: [Dance with suitors] [Refuse] <br>Player chose: Refuse<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No, I don't want the Duke of Sedna to think badly of me. I will skip the dancing.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Very well.<br> Between the dances, there is time for the guests to mingle, chat, and sample tiny bites of exquisite food.<br> During a lull in the music, Banion, the duke of Maree, taps an elegant fingernail against a wineglass, letting the clear note ring out through the room.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might have your attention?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I believe we should offer our compliments to our lovely hostess.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Her bravery and courage keep our borders defended.<br> Everyone applauds politely.<br> As the gala continues, you take the opportunity to observe nobles that you rarely see.<br> There's Gwenelle, for instance - the Young Lady of Sudbury, only months older than you and due to finally inherit control of her duchy soon.<br> Or Adele, the youngest daughter of the Duchess of Lillah and a fierce sportswoman. She was a few years ahead of you at school and the absolute terror of the ballfields.<br> No Briony - she had said her parents were leaving her stuck at school this season.<br> Her parents are here, dancing together - the Duke-Consort clutching his Duchess possessively tight.<br> Strange that there's no sign of your cousins, though. Shouldn't they be here?<br> Your aunt and uncle <i>are</i> here, of course. It would be scandalous if they hadn't come, Merva being so close by.<br> It's nice to be able to enjoy time with friends and family, isn't it?<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br>(Put on the lumen outfit.)<br><hr>Week 18<br><br>(Studied Sense Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Sense Magic in the afternoon.)<br> You wander downstairs to visit your father and talk about the latest events in the domain.<br> You're moving with such enthusiasm that you don't realise your father isn't alone until it's too late to avoid him and his... companion.<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: You are too kind, Joslyn.<br> Countess Sirin. <i>Not</i> a member of your circles - she's a bit more than a decade your senior, far too old to have ever been your friend. And yet, not at all old, as noblewomen go.<br> She has two minor titles, no husband, and <i>your father's arm in her grasp.</i><br> How <i>dare</i> she make a move on your father?<br>Menu: [Shame her with silent scorn] [Insult her with false flattery] [Trip her as she passes] <br>Player chose: Shame her with silent scorn<br> You meet her eyes and imagine your mother's disapproving presence behind you.<br> She notices your stare, but only smiles at you ever-so-sweetly.<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Darling Elodie. I hope you have been well.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ... Fine.<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Perhaps we'll be seeing more of each other in the future.<br> She gives a little wave and exits.<br> Once she's gone, you raise an eyebrow at your father.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This is the path that you have set us on.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your acts have made everyone think about preparations for the future. Caloris needs an heir.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: My brother, your uncle Armand, is looking for a wife as well. One of us, at least, must produce more children.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But... Mama...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Nothing can ever replace your mother.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: But we all have to do things that we don't want to do.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You should be careful how you deal with people like Sirin. You need the goodwill of your nobles as well as your commoners.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There haven't been any problems so far.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you must be aware of everything around you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I am paying attention to what's around me!)<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 19<br><br>(Studied Resist Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Resist Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It is the time of year to decide any necessary adjustments to the royal budget.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The majority of the money we receive is already spoken for, but there is always some room for discretion.<br> Based on the records and notes of current expenditures, if you maintain the current rate of tax, you will still have nine thousand, one hundred and twenty gold lassi and fifty silver tilassi available for special projects.<br> You can't imagine any reason that you would need to spend so much. You could afford to lower taxes.<br> Four thousand lassi should be enough to cover any military surprises for the rest of the year.<br> Any little trade disruption shouldn't need more than a few hundred lassi to sort out, at least temporarily.<br>Menu: [Raise taxes] [Keep them the same] [Lower taxes] <br>Player chose: Lower taxes<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I think we have enough money... Let's lower the taxes a little.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Pssst! I need to talk to you!<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: What is it?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: That priestess, Selene... She's a <i>Lumen!</i> I can sense it!<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I know.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, you know? If you knew that, why didn't you tell me?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You didn't need to know.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your job is managing the domain. Some of us have other duties. Our missions have been passed down for <i>centuries,</i> little princess.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: We are here to train you. You don't need to know any more than that.<br>Menu: [Order her to explain] [Let it go] <br>Player chose: Order her to explain<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You're supposed to obey me! I order you to tell me everything you know!<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That would require more time than we have available. If you survive, you will learn.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Gahh!)<br><hr>Week 20<br><br>(Studied Wield Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Wield Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A man has been convicted of the murder-by-strangling of his wife.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He does not deny the act, but requests a pardon that he might be set free.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: If you admit you killed your wife, why do you think I'm going to set you free?<br>Condemned Man: Save me, Your Majesty! Wasn't my fault. <i>Demons</i> made me do it.<br>Condemned Man: Everyone knows the power of magical beasties! They used me, they twisted my fingers into chains...<br>Condemned Man: My wife found me screaming, she tried to shake me, and the chains wrapped around her...<br>Condemned Man: I need the priestesses to bless me and make me clean again!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Demons? This man is a <i>Lumen!</i> Where did he get a crystal?)<br>Menu: [Question him about crystal] [Pardon him] [Imprison him] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Question him about crystal<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It was a demon's magic that killed your wife? Not your own magic?<br>Condemned Man: ... So you know what I am.<br> He throws out his hands, and his fingertips elongate into floating strings of gold.<br>Condemned Man: DIE!<br> Golden chains slash at you like whips.<br> With so much warning, of course, it is easy for you to resist. His attack bounces harmlessly off your shields, the chains flying back in the direction from which they came... where they find an easier target.<br> Before your eyes, the renegade Lumen is choked to death by his own powers.<br> After a moment, an orange crystal materialises next to his body.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I guess I'll have to take that for safe keeping.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 21<br><br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: My lady, there is a letter for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Who sent this? It isn't signed...)<br> It appears to be a poem, describing you in a manner that is entirely inappropriate for a Queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I *what*? With a *squid*?)<br>Menu: [That's hilarious!] [That's terrible!] <br>Player chose: That's hilarious!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's actually pretty funny!)<br> Just then, an incredibly unlucky breeze swirls between the windows of your tower bedroom, tugging the paper out of your hands and off into the sky.<br> You stick your head out the window to discover the 'poem' caught and fluttering on the roof nearby. You can <i>almost</i> reach it.<br>Menu: [Climb out and grab it] [Ignore it] <br>Player chose: Ignore it<br> What's the worst that can happen? It blows off and someone reads it and laughs at you? That's better than breaking your neck.<br> Besides, if you're lucky it will rain and wash the words away.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: If you attack an enemy Lumen, and you win, and they leave behind a crystal...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is it possible to combine that crystal with mine to make it stronger?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Each Lumen can hold only one crystal.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The only way to combine their magic is if a living wielder <i>chooses</i> to join its power to another.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So I should destroy other crystals, to stop anyone from using them against me.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is the traditional policy - but it is a lie. Lumen crystals cannot be destroyed.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Rulers claim otherwise to discourage thieves from seeking dangerous treasures.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What <i>am</i> I supposed to do with a crystal, then?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Guard it, or hide it, or give it into other hands to wield.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: But if the last holder of the crystal was an enemy, the resonance of the crystal will work against you.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It will be attuned to a personality as foolish or violent or scheming as the Lumen you defeated.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So anyone taking the crystal would probably become a new enemy. That's useless!<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: A weak-willed candidate might be acceptable to the crystal and yet still controllable.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You could then steer that Lumen away from dangerous paths, making an ally and changing the crystal's resonance.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It is, however, a dangerous endeavor and one that requires your complete attention.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Not really a project I can work on while I'm so busy studying for my coronation.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Well, it's only one crystal. That's not too much trouble.)<br><hr>Week 22<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Strategy in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
You may now tour the Barracks on the weekends.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I regret to inform you that Fabian, the Earl of Titan and Duke-Regent of Elath, has passed away.<br> This isn't really a surprise; he was pretty old. The problem is the political implications.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: With the control of Elath in doubt, it falls to the crown to make decisions.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Young Lord Adair will not reach his fifteenth birthday for over two years. He requires a regent.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: His stepmother, Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, has petitioned that the boy be left in her care.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This would, however, leave her in personal control of two neighboring duchies, which is generally forbidden.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Almost the entire eastern border.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything really <i>bad</i> about her, though...)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The boy does have a living grandfather, the Earl of Ishtar. Or you might appoint an unrelated noble to act in his stead.<br>Menu: [Leave him with Arisse] [Send him to his grandfather] [Send him to your uncle] <br>Player chose: Send him to his grandfather<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The Earl of Ishtar is the closest blood relation that Adair has. He should be regent.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br>(Put on the military outfit.)<br><hr>Week 23<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She is a musician and wishes Crown patronage.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Which means money.)<br>Sabine: Your Royal Highness! If you accept me as a member of your court I will immortalise you in word and song.<br>Sabine: I have dabbled in musical styles from many countries, and can entertain your guests and lighten your evenings.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I wonder if she also writes naughty poetry?)<br> The musician sings a little ditty to demonstrate her skills with the lute.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's actually pretty good.)<br>Menu: [Accept her as Court Musician] [Reject her] <br>Player chose: Accept her as Court Musician<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Very well, you can remain as part of the court.<br>Sabine: I will do my best for you!<br> A walk in the fresh air helps you forget the burdens on your shoulders.<br><hr>Week 24<br><br>(Studied Polearms in the morning.)<br>(Studied Polearms in the afternoon.)<br> You receive a letter from Young Lord Adair.<br> It's an extremely formal letter for such a little boy, thanking you for your wisdom in allowing him to live with his grandfather (who probably dictated every word he wrote).<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 25<br><br>(Studied Swords in the morning.)<br>(Studied Swords in the afternoon.)<br> Staring up into the sky out your window, you notice a strange flash of light.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A falling star...

<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What a beautiful day!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's nice to stop and breathe sometimes.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br>(Put on the military outfit.): (Put on the weapons outfit.)<br><hr>Week 27<br><br>(Studied Archery in the morning.)<br>(Studied Archery in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: My lady, there are letters for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Another letter from Briony. Why does she keep writing me? We were never even friends.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She says she's bored and lonely and she's looking forward to seeing me at Gwenelle's birthday party.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's right! Gwenelle is about to turn fifteen! She'll be Duchess of Sudbury for real now.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (This other letter must be my invitation to her birthday celebration next week.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Gwenelle and I were friends at school, and this will be a big event, but it's also a long way to travel.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A lot of things can happen on the road.)<br>Menu: [Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party] [Send your regrets] <br>Player chose: Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It'll be good to see my friends!)<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 28<br><br>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br>(Studied Archery in the afternoon.)<br> You have nothing more to learn about Archery.<br> On your journey to Sudbury, your carriage is attacked by bandits!<br> You hear the distinctive sound of incoming arrows just in time to push yourself away from the window and avoid being shot.<br> From the screams outside, not all of your guards have been as lucky.<br> The attackers scatter as soon as your forces show signs of resistance, vanishing into the woods.<br> The rest of your trip passes without incident, but you can't help jumping at shadows.<br> Gwenelle's party is lovely - not nearly as glamourous as your own upcoming birthday will be, of course, but it's still a major event on the noble social calendar. Everyone who is anyone is present.<br> Uncle Laurent and your younger cousins are here, but Charlotte and her mother are not. Apparently Charlotte was ill.<br> Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, is present, but she somehow always manages to avoid talking to you when you draw near.<br> There are refreshments and dancers and musicians and polite conversations... and one or two not-so-polite.<br>Lieke, Countess of Dis: ... will not be shoved aside.<br>Gwenelle, Duchess of Sudbury: Mother, it's my domain now. I need space for myself. You have your own lands to manage.<br>Lieke, Countess of Dis: Just because you're of age doesn't mean you know everything, young lady. You need my advice.<br>Gwenelle, Duchess of Sudbury: This is my home. It has never been yours.<br> Before you can back away, their gazes fall on you. They wait expectantly for you as near-queen to settle the dispute.<br>Menu: [Side with Gwenelle] [Side with her mother] <br>Player chose: Side with Gwenelle<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You heard her. She's an adult now, and she's in charge here.<br>Gwenelle, Duchess of Sudbury: Thank you!<br>Lieke, Countess of Dis: Is this what your father will face upon your coronation? Cast aside without another word?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (... He's not going to like hearing that, is he.)<br> A bit later, Briony catches up with you.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: Hello, Elodie. It's so wonderful that you're going to be Queen now.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: I mean, I am sorry about your mother...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thanks.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: ... but think of the opportunities you're going to have! You're so lucky.<br> That's an odd way of putting it.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: Anyway, I was wondering, now that you're almost Queen and everything... have they told you all the secrets?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What secrets?<br>Briony, Lady Mead: Like, how to get into the old palace! I've heard it's packed full of treasure.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Old palace?<br>Briony, Lady Mead: The one at Kathre Lake! Where the Kings and Queens of Nova used to live.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't know anything about it.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: Oh.<br> She bites her lip and frowns at you.<br>Briony, Lady Mead: Well, never mind, then.<br> She walks away. So much for wanting to talk to you!<br> At the end, you all share a pleasant meal and prepare to return to your various lands.<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br> There are approximately nine battalions and one platoon under your direct command.<br><hr>Week 29<br><br>(Studied Resist Magic in the morning.)<br> You have nothing more to learn about Resist Magic.<br>(Studied Sense Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: The Duchess of Lillah has sent you a gift.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's this?<br> It's a cushion, finely embroidered with the design of a running horse. It's well done, and clearly required hours and hours of needlework, but it's also fairly useless.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: That's nice... I guess.<br>Menu: [Keep it] [Give it to Alice] <br>Player chose: Keep it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Find a chair or sofa to set it on.<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br> There are approximately nine battalions and one platoon under your direct command.<br><hr>Week 30<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Wield Magic in the afternoon.)<br> You have nothing more to learn about Wield Magic.<br>Alice: The Duchess of Mead is here to see you, my lady.<br>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: Hello, Elodie. I'm sorry to trouble you, but - have you seen Briony?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Not since the party last week.<br> She shakes her head.<br>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: She's gone missing. She's not at school where she should be. I know she was unhappy, but I never expected...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She was asking questions at the party about the old Novan palace, but then she wandered off.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm sorry, I really don't know.<br>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: The... Oh, no.

We need something cheerful.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You could hold a tournament.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What a good idea!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Knights, jousting, musicians... all sorts of competitions. Everyone loves a contest.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: What will you offer as prizes to the winners?<br>Menu: [Status and praise] [Employment] [Gold] <br>Player chose: Gold<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: A purse of gold for the champions!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Very well. I will draft the announcements.<br> You leave him to his work.<br> As you move through the hall, your eye falls upon a vase of flowers. Pretty, but apparently not getting enough water.

Those flowers should be replaced.)<br> You continue up the stairs to your room, where a maid is waiting for you.<br>Alice: My lady, a gift has arrived from Kigal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: From the Duke?<br>Alice: No, my lady. A merchant house, I believe. It was sent with a shipment down the Cavalla River.<br> You tear open the brightly colored paper, to find:<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Chocolates!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Chocolate producers in Kigal usually ship goods down the Napo River through Ursul, not straight to the capital.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (This merchant house probably specialises in something else and only traded for the chocolate.)<br> There is a little card with the box - 'With Our Compliments, The House of Kraellat'.<br>Menu: [Eat candy now] [Save it for later] <br>Player chose: Save it for later<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't feel like candy right now.

As near-Queen, you place flower garlands around their necks.<br> All of a sudden, a man approaches the winner's platform.<br> It's Kevan, the Earl of Io.<br> In one hand, he carries an armored gauntlet. In the other, a sword.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: My family's blood is on your hands!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (What is he talking about?)<br> He casts the metal glove to the ground with a clatter and raises his sword, pointing it at you.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: I challenge you, Elodie! A life for a life!<br> He's challenging you to a duel?<br> Doesn't he know you could burn him to a crisp just by waving your hand?<br>Menu: [Accept] [Refuse] [Kill him with magic] <br>Player chose: Kill him with magic<br> Without a further word, you direct the full force of your magical wrath at the Earl of Io.<br> There is a horrible scream, and the smell of burning flesh.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I decline.<br> Kevan's sword falls to the ground beside his gauntlet. He won't be needing either anymore.<br> After the tournament, a minor tragedy is revealed.<br> One of the stewards apparently had an incredible sweet tooth and dared to steal a piece of your recently-received chocolates. He <i>had</i> a sweet tooth... the chocolates were poisoned.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Good thing I didn't eat them!)<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br> There are approximately nine battalions and one platoon under your direct command.<br>(Put on the military outfit.): (Put on the lumen outfit.): (Put on the medicine outfit.): (Put on the economics outfit.): (Put on the weapons outfit.): (Put on the boarding_school outfit.): (Put on the medicine outfit.): (Put on the weapons outfit.)<br><hr>Week 34<br><br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: My lady, your father wishes to speak with you. He says it's urgent.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine, I'm coming.<br> You find your father standing over a map of the coastline, his face grave.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Ships have been sighted on approach from Shanjia. Not tradeships - this is a warfleet.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Within a week they will be in Novan waters. Within two they could reach the capital.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Then we will fight to defend ourselves.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You can try to use the treasury funds to hire additional soldiers, but it may be difficult on short notice.<br>Menu: [Recruit soldiers] [Don't] <br>Player chose: Recruit soldiers<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine, we'll do that.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What about Talasse? Can we call on any troops from Sedna?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Send a message, but even if he agrees, it will take time for his soldiers to mobilise.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You will need to draw up a naval strategy for our ships to carry out.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You <i>could</i> choose to act as admiral and lead the fleet in person, but the danger to you would be very great.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Unless you think your personal skills will make the difference, I would strongly advise against it.<br>Menu: [Direct the fleet] [Stay in the capital] <br>Player chose: Direct the fleet<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The risk is mine to take.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have your mother's heart.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is one more thing. I hesitate to ask, but...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: An invasion...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This is the sort of disaster for which a Lumen's power may be worth the cost.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If the fleet could be destroyed before they reached our waters, many lives would be saved.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know any magic that could sink a whole fleet!)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I... I'll have to talk to my mentor.<br> You find the Duchess of Ursul in her guest quarters.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: A fleet from Shanjia is attacking us. Is it possible to sink them all with magic?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It is easy enough to attack one soldier, one ship, as a demonstration. But to obliterate an entire fleet...<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You would need an immense amount of power spread over a large area, more than any one Lumen could control.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: If you tried to raise that much power yourself, you would die. Not could. Would.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So it's hopeless.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Not necessarily.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The most dangerous power of Imperial Nova was that of Lumens acting in concert.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: If the need is great and the will is true, one Lumen may choose to give command of her power to another.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Three, perhaps four people working together might have the strength to destroy a fleet.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You, me, and Selene. Will that be enough?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It might. Are you willing to take the risk? Such power has its price.<br>Menu: [Yes] [No] <br>Player chose: Yes<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is what I was born for. I say we do it.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Then we will begin the preparations.<br> You sneak down to the castle dungeons and amuse yourself by poking the locked-up peasants with sticks. Poor fools.<br>(Put on the military outfit.)<br><hr>Week 35<br><br>(Studied Swords in the morning.)<br>(Studied Swords in the afternoon.)<br> Danger on the high seas!<br> You and your two fellow Lumens join hands to focus your powers.<br> Your magical training has paid off by allowing you to stage this attempt at a safe distance from the invading vessels of war.<br> In the distance, the sea stirs. Ripples become waves become triangular peaks of water, causing enemy ships to tilt crazily and batter into one another.<br> It is a terrible storm, but it is not enough. You have damaged their fleet, but the fleet still sails. Now it will come down to the naval battle.<br> Ships close in on each other, angling into range.<br> You take your position with a spyglass, watching the enemy movements closely and shouting out any necessary changes in plan.<br> You now have an edge over the Shanjian forces in terms of numbers, but it could all come down to strategy.<br> Your skill in long-range magic makes you as effective as a cannon (and more maneuverable), but there are far too many ships for you to take each one out individually.<br> The eventual outcome...<br> ... is a hard-fought victory.<br> You have repelled the invasion fleet, driving the survivors back across the sea. You and your sailors are heroes, and Nova is safe once more.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 36<br><br>(Studied Trade in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The magical storms you summoned created giant waves which swept inland as well as out.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Damage has been reported along the shoreline from Mazomba down to northern Maree.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The beaches are covered with wrack and the bodies of animals, and many fishers and cocklers are missing.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Are you blaming me?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Of course not. Many more lives would have been lost if the fleet had landed.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: What worries me is that these reports are increasing, even long after the events of the battle.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: More than that, an observatory in Caloris has seen strange shapes in the sea to the west.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Something worse than a simple storm may have been unleashed.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Does that mean... a sea monster?)<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br>(Put on the economics outfit.)<br><hr>Week 37<br><br>(Studied Swimming in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br> In the grand hall, your father is waiting for you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Our fears have been realised. A kraken has risen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: A kraken?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: An enormous tentacled sea monster which can dive and surface at will.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It is fast, voracious, and apparently unkillable. Any ship that ventures into its range is at risk.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This could destroy Nova's shipping.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (And ocean shipping is really important to our economy!)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What can we do? Do we just wait and hope it goes away?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: No.<br> Quite unexpectedly, the priestess strides into the room.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: What are you doing here?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I came to bring the records of the circle, so that you would know what you face.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Left alone, the beast will feed until the seas run red, and only then will it sleep.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: It would cost hundreds of thousands of lives.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: !<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: There are only two ways to end its threat.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Lumen spellweaving can freeze a kraken in its tracks, holding it motionless - but only for a short time.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: If the spell is renewed every moon giving the beast no time between castings to move freely...<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: It should eventually sleep.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How long would that take?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Approximately seven years.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (<i>Years!</i>)<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: But if at any point the spell cast is too weak, or is not renewed in time, it would break loose.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: And the treasury would be drained keeping up such a routine. What is the other way?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: It is well-known that eldritch beasts can be driven out by... sacrifice.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The life-force of a Lumen or potential Lumen on the cusp of adulthood, would be the ideal choice.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: <i>No!</i> You will <i>not</i> take my daughter!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You see, Elodie! <i>This</i> is why I told you to reject them! They are <i>all</i> witches!<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Even without her mother's crystal, she would <i>still</i> have been a potential Lumen.<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Keeping her ignorant would not have kept her safe.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will not allow this!<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The choice belongs to the Queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Me.)<br>Menu: [Sacrifice yourself] [Try to seal it] <br>Player chose: Try to seal it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We'll have to do our best to seal the kraken away, no matter how long it takes.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: After all, isn't that what our magic is for? To defend the world from darkness?<br>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I will teach you the necessary spells. You must arrange the transportation.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Very well.<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br><hr>Week 38<br><br>(Studied Swimming in the morning.)<br>(Studied Swimming in the afternoon.)<br> Your skill in Swimming is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Athletics skills are 25 or higher.<br> Time has slipped by you so quickly. Only two weeks remain before your birthday celebration, and your official coronation as Queen. Have you done enough to build a stable Nova?<br> The first of your soon-to-be-regular voyages has now set out with Selene on board. She appears to have some special affinity with sea water which makes her the best choice to guide a vessel while it hunts for the elusive beast. After all, you have to <i>find</i> it before you can enchant it.<br> It is traditional for the palace to provide entertainment and refreshment for the common people when a new monarch is crowned. It is a rare opportunity for the poor of the land to dine like nobles.<br> The size and scope of any such feast depends on what expense the royal treasury is willing to bear.<br>Menu: [An extravagant feast] [A respectable feast] [A small feast] [No celebration] <br>Player chose: An extravagant feast<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Roasted meats, cakes, chocolates, wine, enough for everyone! And I can give out commemorative cups and coins!)<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br><hr>Week 39<br><br>(Studied Running in the morning.)<br>(Studied Climbing in the afternoon.)<br> The castle is buzzing with preparations for your upcoming coronation. Ministers press you with details for your favorite colors and flowers and so on.<br> You really can't see the point of wasting time worrying about decorations when there's so much else to worry about.<br> Others are more interested in the subject of your marriage.<br> It can't take place until you are of age, of course, and considering all the preparations (and the need to recover from the coronation) not for much longer than that. Still, it doesn't stop people from buzzing around full of ideas and suggestions.<br> You are impressed by the discipline of the Novan troops, but the responsibility for their lives weighs heavily on your shoulders.<br><hr>Week 40<br><br>(Studied Running in the morning.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>(Studied Swimming in the afternoon.)<br> At this time last year, you were celebrating your fourteenth birthday. You were in the school gardens, surrounded by your friends. A teacher brought you tea and cakes, while a wealthy merchant's son wove a crown of flowers for your head.<br> It didn't matter so much that you were a princess then. Your title was something for the future. Many of your peers <i>would be</i> Duchesses or Earls or the like, someday, but not then. You were children.<br> Your parents could not attend on the actual day, but they did send wonderful gifts, some for you, and some for you to share. And a week later, they came for a visit, and your mother took you with her through the countryside in a splendid carriage.<br> It was the last time you would ever see her.<br> You wonder if, wherever she is, she can see you now.<br> You are fifteen years old, a legal adult. You have worked and studied and suffered and prepared, and now the time has come.<br> You kneel before the priestess, barely hearing her words as she recites the blessings.<br> She calls upon the gods to deliver peace, wisdom, and prosperity to you, and through you, to all of Nova. And then she calls upon you, for your oath of rulership.<br>Priestess of the First Circle: Will you guide and govern and protect your people to the best of your ability, according to law and custom?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I will.<br>Priestess of the First Circle: Will you to the best of your power uphold the ideals of love, honor, justice, and mercy?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I will.<br>Priestess of the First Circle: Lords and Ladies assembled: I present to you your undoubted Queen, who has sworn you her loyalty.<br>Priestess of the First Circle: You who have come to give homage, will you do the same?<br> One at a time, the head of each duchy approaches your throne and kneels to swear his or her service to you and your heirs.<br>Priestess of the First Circle: People of Nova, I give you Elodie, daughter of Fidelia, your true sovereign. What say you all?<br>People: LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!<br>Elodie, Queen of Nova: (Thank you! I will!)<br>The following year, Elodie and Talarist were married in a ceremony that threatened to rival her coronation for pomp and splendour.<br>Talarist brought with him a gift of fine white horses, and encouraged his young wife to amuse herself while he enjoyed his new place in Novan politics. He was clearly in no hurry to provide an heir to the throne.<br>Once his daughter was secure on her throne, Joslyn returned to his birthplace to focus on his duties as Duke of Caloris.<br>He soon became engaged to the Countess Sirin.<br>The Queen and her trusted Lumens sailed out every week to check on the condition of the kraken and reinforce the seals. It was inevitable that others would discover their secret and blame them for it. After all, the old Novan capital had been rendered uninhabitable by monstrous Lumen experiments. A tentacled beast from the deep was just more of the same.<br>The Novan people were not the only ones to notice the increased naval traffic and the frequent absences of the young Lumen Queen. Pirates from Orcus stepped up their raids in the area, hoping to take Elodie hostage and ransom her for a fortune.<br>The Queen was forced to engage an even larger naval escort to make her regular trips to the binding site, and the Novan economy struggled under the burden.<br>The loss of their fleet was a terrible setback for Shanjia. However, as with a garden weed, if the root is not burned out completely the infestation may return even worse than before. The King of Shanjia had somehow escaped either drowning or capture and returned to his homeland to plot revenge against Nova.<br>Raising a new army put a strain on the Shanjian royal treasury, which brought internal tensions among the former city-states to the fore. It would be some years before Shanjia could manage to field a conquering horde again.<br>The invention of the printing press sparked the beginning of a new age of literacy and knowledge. No longer were books the sole preserve of the noble and wealthy; now information and ideas could be easily passed from one place to another. As the birthplace of this invention, Nova was at the center of a storm of change.<br>And thus Queen Elodie's legacy stretched into the future...<br></body></html>
