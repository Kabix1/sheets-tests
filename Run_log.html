Your room is just the way you left it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: *sigh*<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br>Player chose: I've played this before<br><hr>Week 1<br><br>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I love this room! It's so much bigger than mine back home.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You should visit more often. It's awful that the only time I get to see you is...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ... something like this.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I know your brother and sister are still too young, but why haven't you come to school?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: My mother worries about me. She doesn't think anywhere but home is safe.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I understand. I'm probably not going to be allowed to leave this castle until my birthday.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But at least we can have fun together here!<br><hr>Week 2<br><br>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br>Player chose: Let her stay<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I want to hear what she has to say.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She stays.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you know about Lumens?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Why?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad was really angry at the Duchess of Ursul.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Mummy says people are scared of Lumens because they're jealous. There used to be lots of them in Nova, but there aren't anymore.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Why not?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I don't know. Maybe someone burned them.<br><hr>Week 3<br><br>(Studied World History in the morning.)<br>(Studied Lore in the afternoon.)<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br> All of a sudden, the Duchess of Ursul rushes into the garden and points a sword at you!<br> No, not at you. At your... feet?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Princess! Don't move!<br>Menu: [Hold still] [Look down] <br>Player chose: Hold still<br> You want to hold still, but you don't have the composure to hold your position without peeking.<br> You look down where her sword is pointing.<br> There's a <b>snake</b> in the grass!<br> You can't help it - you squeak and jump back. The snake tenses and prepares to strike.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: No!<br> Your cousin pushes you aside, and the snake's fangs sink into her leg.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie!<br> Too late, Julianna swings her sword and cuts off the snake's head.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What is going on out here?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your daughter's been bitten by a milk viper. They're poisonous. Get an herbalist, right away!<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: <b>I</b> will treat my daughter. I certainly can't trust anyone here to keep her safe!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm sorry...<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I don't feel good.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: We will be returning home to Merva immediately.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your aunt has a point. Milk vipers are not native to this area. That snake should never have been here.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Someone may have tried to kill you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Will Charlotte be okay?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I don't know.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 4<br><br>(Studied Poison in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I was so worried about Charlotte, after that snake bit her...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But her mother said she's okay, so I guess it turned out all right.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe she has a guardian angel!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What is it you wanted to teach me?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: First, I need to know if you have your mother's crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: A Lumen crystal? No.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The Royal Crystal has been passed down from ruler to ruler for generations. It belongs to you, now - except that the King may be keeping it from you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Do you have a crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Of course.<br> She holds out her hands. Light flickers above her bosom, and then, with a shower of sparkles, something takes shape.<br> You reach out to touch it, and it dissolves away into nothing.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It belongs to me. No one can take it from me until I die.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You need to find the crystal that belongs to you.<br><hr>Week 5<br><br>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br>(Studied Flattery in the afternoon.)<br> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We have a Duke of Sedna?<br>Alice: ... No, my Lady. The duchy of Sedna is in Talasse.<br>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It might not be appropriate for me to wear a man's gift in public, though. People would think it meant something.<br>Menu: [Wear it] [Don't wear it] <br>Player chose: Don't wear it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's important to maintain the proper image.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How do I find my Lumen crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your father probably knows what happened to it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What if he destroyed it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: They can't be destroyed. He could throw it away, but then someone else might find it. No, he'll keep it safe.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But if it's mine, it wouldn't matter if someone else found it.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It's attuned to you, but you haven't bonded with it yet. If it found a compatible host, someone who was <i>like</i> you in some way, it could bond to them.<br><hr>Week 6<br><br>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking, you spot a familiar figure in the palace gardens.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's the Duchess of Ursul! Maybe I should go and say hello.)<br> Then you notice that seated beside her is a woman in the robes of a priestess. They are very close together, their hands gently touching as they speak.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Looks like she's busy!)<br> You turn and walk in a different direction, so as not to disturb them. At that moment, you notice something unusual. It looks like someone just left the palace grounds by going over the hedge.<br> Was that a servant? A thief? Or... an assassin?<br>Menu: [Climb up to look over the hedge] [Call the guards] [Run and hide] <br>Player chose: Climb up to look over the hedge<br> You look around for something to climb, but you're not sure if the nearby trees can support your weight.<br> You run over to a statue and try to pull yourself up onto the pedestal, but it's too awkward to get your feet in place.<br> By this time, whoever you saw is probably gone anyway.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 7<br><br>(Studied Decoration in the morning.)<br>(Studied Falcons in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br> Before you can react, she barrels into you, sending you and the sheets flying.<br>Alice: Oh, my lady! I'm so sorry!<br>Menu: [Apologise] [Punish her] <br>Player chose: Apologise<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No, it was my fault. I should have gotten out of your way.<br>Alice: ... If you say so, my lady.<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 8<br><br>(Studied Instrument in the morning.)<br>(Studied Dogs in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know much about factories or trade. Would that really be worthwhile?)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br><hr>Week 9<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (His sister, the Duchess of Hellas, started trouble in Ixion four years ago, so they invaded his territory as payback.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything about the military. I don't want to fight.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might say so, you are looking particularly lovely this day. I hope you will think fondly of me.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is he flirting with me? He's almost as old as my father!)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad, what happened to Mom's Lumen crystal?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It's in a safe place.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Can I have it?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But it's mine!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Meddling with magic killed your mother. I don't want that to happen to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Once you're crowned Queen, I can't stop you from doing anything you want, but for now you are still a child.<br><hr>Week 10<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Ciphering in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It was the Duchess of Hellas who tried to take over part of Ixion's territory, without the support of my mother the Queen.)<br>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We appreciate that you feel wronged. One of our subjects attempted to instigate a rebellion in your territory.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: However, she did not have our approval for these actions. If you withdraw your troops, we will punish her.<br>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Your Highness!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is the fair solution. You have no right to invade us because of her actions.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: What manner of punishment were you considering?<br>Menu: [Make her a commoner] [Command her to marry an Ixionite] [Execute her] <br>Player chose: Command her to marry an Ixionite<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She will marry an Ixionite lord of your choosing.<br>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: I will not!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You will if I say you will, or I'll take your title away!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Her heirs will be of your blood, in a peaceful union that benefits us both.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Very well. We will accept this arrangement.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Remember that my sister is not the only unmarried noblewoman in Nova.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (People will expect me to find a husband too.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father says I can't have the crystal until I'm Queen, so we'll just have to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: There may not be time to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: This world is filled with dangers, and you will need the powers of a Lumen to fight them. You can't begin training until you have bonded with your crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what else am I supposed to do about it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The crystal is probably held under guard in the Royal Treasury. You are the princess; you should be able to find a way inside.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Otherwise we might have to take drastic action.<br>Menu: [I'll wait until I'm older] [I'll try to find a way] [What drastic action?] <br>Player chose: What drastic action?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean by drastic action?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Try to reach the crystal. If you can't, come and talk to me again.<br><hr>Week 11<br><br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 12<br><br>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the morning.)<br>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She wishes Crown funding for a project.<br>Woman: Thank you for seeing me, Your Royal Highness. I... I come to you on behalf of the people.<br>Woman: I wish to build a hospital where any citizen afflicted with disease can be brought for treatment.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Putting all the sick people together? Wouldn't that make them die even faster?)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br><hr>Week 13<br><br>(Studied Decoration in the morning.)<br>(Studied Decoration in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A woman has been convicted of attempted murder and requests the mercy of the Crown.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Your Highness! This slattern dares to beg pardon, when she <b>admits</b> that she tried to poison my sister under her own roof!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Which sister?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Corisande, the Duchess of Mead.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is she all right?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: She is unharmed. We caught the culprit in the kitchens before anyone could eat her foul spew.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?<br>Condemned Woman: It's justice, it is! Them devils killed me brother, and broke me mam's heart.<br>Condemned Woman: Lied to her, they did, when she went to see why he'd not come back. Said he'd gone for a soldier, when he never would!<br>Condemned Woman: He weren't the only one neither. I waited ten years for my chance to get my own back. That's justice!<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: You see? She's completely unrepentant! Hang her and be done with it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hmm. This might have something to do with the last Duke of Mead. He was involved in all sorts of scandals.)<br>Menu: [Put her to work] [Imprison her] [Execute her] [Ask the Earl of Io about her story] <br>Player chose: Ask the Earl of Io about her story<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I need to know if she has any justification for her actions.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: <i>Did</i> the old Duke kill her brother?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Are you <i>accusing</i> my family?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm asking what happened!<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: The honor of our line is far greater than that of the wet-bottomed child who sits the throne!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br> Without warning, the Earl of Io draws a dagger and slices the convict's throat.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: No one harms my family. No one!<br> He throws the blood-stained blade to the floor and walks away.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Ooooo!<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 14<br><br>(Studied Poison in the morning.)<br>(Studied Herbs in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking one day in the gardens, you hear a strange sound and look up to see an owl flying overhead. A single dry leaf flutters in its talons.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (An owl flying in the open in broad daylight? That's unusual. I wonder if something attacked it?)<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br><hr>Week 15<br><br>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br>(Studied Instrument in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember that the Festival of the Good Lady is approaching.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There will be public celebrations for the commoners, followed by a grand gala for the nobility.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A grand ball... There will be dancing.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you would be expected to lead the procession and take part in the ceremonial planting, possibly give a speech.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: However, since you are not yet crowned, it is not required, and it may not be safe to expose you to the public.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, not safe?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Outside of the castle, you are less well protected. If anyone means you harm... Think on it now, decide later.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a letter for you as well.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's from Briony! I went to school with her, but she's a couple years older than me. Her mother is the Duchess of Mead.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's complaining that her mother still won't let her come home for the holidays.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Apparently her uncle Kevan is absolutely furious about that woman's trial.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's bored and looking for an adventure. Well, I don't have any to suggest to her!)<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 16<br><br>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Presence in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Today is the procession and planting for the Festival of the Good Lady. Will you be leading the parade?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If you have any concerns about your safety, please, stay here.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The people will recover from disappointment; if we lose you, there is no recovery.<br>Menu: [I will lead the parade] [I will parade and make a speech] [I would rather not go] <br>Player chose: I will lead the parade<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm not afraid. I'm going to be the best parade-leader ever!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: My little girl.<br> You prepare your best gown for the occasion, then walk slowly through the town with your attendants. It would not be appropriate for you to wear a sword, but you do walk with a sturdy golden scepter that's taller than you are.<br> At the end of the route, you help the priestesses turn over the earth for the new tree to be planted.<br> Then the new life is blessed, and all the attendants join in song.<br> The procession regroups to return to the castle.<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 17<br><br>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Are you ready for the grand ball?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All the nobles in the domain are here to see you - to see their queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (gulp!)<br> You finish dressing and descend the stairs to make a grand entrance.<br> All around, the rich and powerful pause in their activities to gaze upon you, the ruler of them all.<br> Seeing yourself reflected in so many eyes makes you want to run away and hide.<br> After a moment, you force yourself to carry on, but you're sure they've all seen you hesitate.<br> Your father waits for you at the bottom of the stairs and offers you his arm.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The first dance is for us.<br> He guides you gently around the dance floor, never rushing you. It's fun to dance with your father, but the look in his eyes is so sad.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: After this, you must choose your own partner. There are a number of men who hope to catch your eye.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke of Kigal alone has brought three eligible sons, all near your age.<br> You look around the room at all your possible partners - which is to say, everyone. No one may begin dancing until you do. You can pick whomever you want and you will not be denied.<br>Menu: [Someone about your age] [Someone younger than you] [Someone older than you] [Someone already married] [Someone scandalous] <br>Player chose: Someone about your age<br> You approach Linley, the second son of the Duke of Kigal. He's about two years older than you, and he was always nice to you at school.<br> He bows to you with great courtesy and you begin to dance.<br> Dancing with a real partner feels quite different from dancing with your father. You knew him, knew his steps like a part of you. Now every move is a mystery.<br> Unfortunately, you lose track of which steps you're supposed to do when, and trip over your own feet. Oops!<br> Between the dances, there is time for the guests to mingle, chat, and sample tiny bites of exquisite food.<br> During a lull in the music, Banion, the duke of Maree, taps an elegant fingernail against a wineglass, letting the clear note ring out through the room.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might have your attention?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I believe we should offer our compliments to our lovely hostess.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Not only does she protect our borders, but she has begun to address the long-standing problem of a shortage of heirs.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: My sister is proud to do her duty. As, of course, are others, such as myself and our lovely new queen.<br> You can almost hear the chorus of eyebrows being raised.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: May I have this dance, fair lady?<br>Menu: [Accept] [Refuse] <br>Player chose: Accept<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Certainly.<br> He pulls you close, his hand possessive on your waist, as the orchestra swings back into motion.<br> His head above yours angles down to murmur words that - you hope - no one else can hear.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You realise that you have just admitted to all your guests that you and I are having an affair.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If you don't marry me now, your virtue will be stained.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: That's not fair!<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Little in life is fair, Your Highness. Was it fair to force my sister to marry her enemy?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I need heirs and so do you. I am the highest-ranking eligible man in the domain.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You clearly could not wed your own father or uncle, Young Elath is still a child, and the Duke of Kigal is happily married.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I am the only match worthy of you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You have a point.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You are, of course, too young to marry until after your coronation. You will need time to prepare.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Don't be sad. I want what's best for both of us and our domain.<br> As the gala continues, you take the opportunity to observe nobles that you rarely see.<br> There's Gwenelle, for instance - the Young Lady of Sudbury, only months older than you and due to finally inherit control of her duchy soon.<br> Or Adele, the youngest daughter of the Duchess of Lillah and a fierce sportswoman. She was a few years ahead of you at school and the absolute terror of the ballfields.<br> No Briony - she had said her parents were leaving her stuck at school this season.<br> Her parents are here, dancing together - the Duke-Consort clutching his Duchess possessively tight.<br> Strange that there's no sign of your cousins, though. Shouldn't they be here?<br> Your aunt and uncle <i>are</i> here, of course. It would be scandalous if they hadn't come, Merva being so close by.<br> It's nice to be able to enjoy time with friends and family, isn't it?<br> You try to explain to the guards that you need to visit the treasury in order to get an accurate report on the domain's finances. They waver slightly, but in the end, they stand by your father's commands.<br><hr>Week 18<br><br>(Studied Production in the morning.)<br>(Studied Production in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: The Duke of Maree has sent you a gift.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: An engagement present?<br> You open the box to reveal a little glass figure of a dancing girl, her hands held above her head.<br>Menu: [Put it away] [Display it] [Smash it] [Give it to Alice] <br>Player chose: Display it<br> You perch the figure on a shelf where she can catch the light.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Pretty.<br> You wander downstairs to visit your father and talk about the latest events in the domain.<br> You're moving with such enthusiasm that you don't realise your father isn't alone until it's too late to avoid him and his... companion.<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: You are too kind, Joslyn.<br> Countess Sirin. <i>Not</i> a member of your circles - she's a bit more than a decade your senior, far too old to have ever been your friend. And yet, not at all old, as noblewomen go.<br> She has two minor titles, no husband, and <i>your father's arm in her grasp.</i><br> How <i>dare</i> she make a move on your father?<br>Menu: [Shame her with silent scorn] [Insult her with false flattery] [Trip her as she passes] <br>Player chose: Trip her as she passes<br> You wait until the Countess gets closer, then hook your foot around to make her stumble.<br> Unfortunately, you get your feet tangled up and end up tripping <i>yourself,</i> falling to the ground with a thud.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Elodie, are you all right?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Oh, dear. She does need a bit of looking after, doesn't she?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Not by you!)<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: I should go now. I hope to see more of you later.<br> Once she's gone, you raise an eyebrow at your father.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This is the path that you have set us on.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your acts have made everyone think about preparations for the future. Caloris needs an heir.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: My brother, your uncle Armand, is looking for a wife as well. One of us, at least, must produce more children.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But... Mama...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Nothing can ever replace your mother.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: But we all have to do things that we don't want to do.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You should be careful how you deal with people like Sirin. You need the goodwill of your nobles as well as your commoners.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There haven't been any problems so far.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Many dark looks were aimed your way at the gala.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you must be aware of everything around you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Isn't that what I have agents for?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Yes, but you must give them direction. What is your greatest concern?<br>Menu: [Noble plots] [Commoner uprisings] [Foreign threats] [Assassins] <br>Player chose: Noble plots<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I need to know what the other nobles are up to, and whether anyone is plotting behind my back.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 19<br><br>(Studied Trade in the morning.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It is the time of year to decide any necessary adjustments to the royal budget.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The majority of the money we receive is already spoken for, but there is always some room for discretion.<br> Based on the records and notes of current expenditures, if you maintain the current rate of tax, you will still have nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five gold lassi and thirteen silver tilassi available for special projects.<br> You can't imagine any reason that you would need to spend so much. You could afford to lower taxes.<br> Any little trade disruption shouldn't need more than a few hundred lassi to sort out, at least temporarily.<br>Menu: [Raise taxes] [Keep them the same] [Lower taxes] <br>Player chose: Keep them the same<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I think they're fine as they are.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You overwhelm the guards with facts and figures, explaining that you need treasury access to adjust the royal budget, which may affect their pay packets as well as the taxes assessed on their friends and family. They stand aside.<br> The glitter is dazzling, but some sixth sense draws you towards one little locked box in particular. <b>This</b> is what you need. This is the crystal that will make you a Lumen.<br> You tuck the box into your pocket. You can show it to your mentor later and get instructions on what to do next.<br>(Put on the economics outfit.)<br><hr>Week 20<br><br>(Studied Archery in the morning.)<br>(Studied Archery in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A man has been convicted of the murder-by-strangling of his wife.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He does not deny the act, but requests a pardon that he might be set free.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: If you admit you killed your wife, why do you think I'm going to set you free?<br>Condemned Man: Save me, Your Majesty! Wasn't my fault. <i>Demons</i> made me do it.<br>Condemned Man: Everyone knows the power of magical beasties! They used me, they twisted my fingers into chains...<br>Condemned Man: My wife found me screaming, she tried to shake me, and the chains wrapped around her...<br>Condemned Man: I need the priestesses to bless me and make me clean again!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Demons that make you attack people? Is that even possible?)<br>Menu: [Pardon him] [Imprison him] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Pardon him<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm very sorry for your loss. The monsters are responsible, not you. Don't blame yourself.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The priestess of the royal grove will take care of purifying you.<br>Condemned Man: Bless you, Your Majesty!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I got it!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do I do now?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Pick up the crystal with your bare hands. Press it against your chest, over your heart, and say <i>"Illuminate!"</i><br>Menu: [Do it] [Don't do it] <br>Player chose: Do it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Okay... Here we go... 
 Illuminate!<br> You feel dizzy, and both larger and lighter than you were before. The crystal has disappeared from view, but <i>you</i> know where it is.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Wow.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The priestess here is a friend of mine. I will come to your lessons in the faith and train you to use your powers.<br><hr>Week 21<br><br>(Studied Swords in the morning.)<br>(Studied Swords in the afternoon.)<br>Alice: My lady, there is a letter for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Who sent this? It isn't signed...)<br> It appears to be a poem, describing you in a manner that is entirely inappropriate for a Queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I *what*? With a *squid*?)<br>Menu: [That's hilarious!] [That's terrible!] <br>Player chose: That's hilarious!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's actually pretty funny!)<br> Just then, an incredibly unlucky breeze swirls between the windows of your tower bedroom, tugging the paper out of your hands and off into the sky.<br> You stick your head out the window to discover the 'poem' caught and fluttering on the roof nearby. You can <i>almost</i> reach it.<br>Menu: [Climb out and grab it] [Ignore it] <br>Player chose: Ignore it<br> What's the worst that can happen? It blows off and someone reads it and laughs at you? That's better than breaking your neck.<br> Besides, if you're lucky it will rain and wash the words away.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 22<br><br>(Studied Polearms in the morning.)<br>(Studied Polearms in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I regret to inform you that Fabian, the Earl of Titan and Duke-Regent of Elath, has passed away.<br> This isn't really a surprise; he was pretty old. The problem is the political implications.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: With the control of Elath in doubt, it falls to the crown to make decisions.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Young Lord Adair will not reach his fifteenth birthday for over two years. He requires a regent.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: His stepmother, Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, has petitioned that the boy be left in her care.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This would, however, leave her in personal control of two neighboring duchies, which is generally forbidden.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Almost the entire eastern border.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything really <i>bad</i> about her, though...)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The boy does have a living grandfather, the Earl of Ishtar. Or you might appoint an unrelated noble to act in his stead.<br>Menu: [Leave him with Arisse] [Send him to his grandfather] [Send him to your uncle] <br>Player chose: Send him to your uncle<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What about your brother Armand? He would be a safe pair of hands to watch over Adair.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br>(Put on the weapons outfit.)<br><hr>Week 23<br><br>(Studied Archery in the morning.)<br>(Studied Archery in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She is a musician and wishes Crown patronage.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Which means money.)<br>Sabine: Your Royal Highness! If you accept me as a member of your court I will immortalise you in word and song.<br>Sabine: I have dabbled in musical styles from many countries, and can entertain your guests and lighten your evenings.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I wonder if she also writes naughty poetry?)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Musicians are often used as secret agents and messengers. They can be useful - and dangerous.)<br> The musician sings a little ditty to demonstrate her skills with the lute.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's actually pretty good.)<br>Menu: [Accept her as Court Musician] [Reject her] <br>Player chose: Accept her as Court Musician<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Very well, you can remain as part of the court.<br>Sabine: I will do my best for you!<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br><hr>Week 24<br><br>(Studied Elegance in the morning.)<br>(Studied Elegance in the afternoon.)<br> You receive a letter from Young Lord Adair.<br> So far, he's enjoying himself with your uncle Armand in Mazomba. He says the trees look different, and there are a lot more frogs. He looks forward to visiting the lookout fort at Shepherd's Point.<br> You also receive an update from your agents. It would seem that the Duchess of Lillah is not pleased with your actions and is putting out feelers amongst the other nobles for support.<br> If she means to rebel against you, that is treason. Unfortunately, she's a long way away, in her own power base. Calling her to order may not be easy.<br> Still, the longer you wait, the more dangerous she may become.<br>Menu: [Send soldiers to arrest her] [Send assassins to kill her] [Wait for more information] <br>Player chose: Wait for more information<br> It's only a rumor so far. If you overreact, you might wind up making your opposition stronger. Your agents will update you as the situation progresses.<br> You visit the royal treasury and check your available funds.<br> You have nine thousand, seven hundred and forty-three gold lassi and eighty-four silver tilassi.<br><hr>Week 25<br><br>(Studied Composure in the morning.)<br>(Studied Composure in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!

You may not increase this skill until your other History skills are 25 or higher.<br>Alice: My lady, there are letters for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Another letter from Briony. Why does she keep writing me? We were never even friends.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She says she's bored and lonely and she's looking forward to seeing me at Gwenelle's birthday party.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's right! Gwenelle is about to turn fifteen! She'll be Duchess of Sudbury for real now.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (This other letter must be my invitation to her birthday celebration next week.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Gwenelle and I were friends at school, and this will be a big event, but it's also a long way to travel.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A lot of things can happen on the road.)<br>Menu: [Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party] [Send your regrets] <br>Player chose: Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It'll be good to see my friends!)<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br>(Put on the weapons outfit.)<br><hr>Week 28<br><br>(Studied Novan History in the morning.)<br>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br> On your journey to Sudbury, your carriage is attacked by bandits!<br> You look down in shock at the arrow which has buried itself in your side. Outside, you can hear screams and curses, but it feels unreal. Your world is centered around pain.<br> You struggle with the arrow, afraid to pull it loose. You heard a story somewhere about pushing arrows through the body, so you brace yourself and give it a shove.<br> Unfortunately, this only drives the arrow deeper into your vital organs, turning a painful wound into a fatal one.<br>Elodie did not survive to reach her coronation.  Nova would have to go on without her.

But it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!<br></body></html>
